# vscode-essential-pack

Essential extension pack that isn't focused on any specific languages. Will be taking suggestions on new extensions to add/remove.

Personally it was made for learning extensions and having a one click access to install my essentials at once. I might release language specific seperate extensions packs later.

You can either download the extension from the releases tab or you can just download it from VSCode Extension Marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=i3p9.vscode-essential-pack
